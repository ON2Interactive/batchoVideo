            question: "What is BatchoCanvas?",
            answer: "BatchoCanvas is a canvas-based video editor that lets you design videos visually using layers and scenes. You can overlay text and shapes on video, choose your canvas size, and export polished MP4 videos without working on a traditional timeline."
        },
        {
            question: "Do I need video editing experience to use it?",
            answer: "No. BatchoCanvas is designed to feel more like a design tool than a traditional video editor. If you can work with layers and pages, you can start creating immediately."
        },
        {
            question: "How does BatchoCanvas differ from timeline editors?",
            answer: "Instead of editing on a timeline, you design directly on a canvas. Videos, text, and shapes are layered visually, scenes act like pages, and layouts stay consistent across exports."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I export in different aspect ratios?",
            answer: "Yes. You can choose from common aspect ratios like 16:9, 9:16, and 1:1—or set custom canvas sizes—and export MP4 videos optimized for social, web, or presentations."
        },
        {
            question: "How are scenes used?",
            answer: "Scenes work like pages. Each scene can have its own layout and content, and you can export scenes individually or as part of a full video."
        },
        {
            question: "Are my projects saved?",
            answer: "Yes. Your projects are saved to your account so you can return, edit, and export whenever you need. You stay in full control of your content."
        },
        {
            question: "What types of videos is BatchoCanvas best for?",
            answer: "BatchoCanvas works especially well for social content, marketing videos, presentations, tutorials, product demos, and branded layouts that need consistent design."
        },
        {
            question: "Is BatchoCanvas still improving?",
            answer: "Yes. BatchoCanvas is actively developed, with regular updates focused on performance, usability, and new creative capabilities."
        },
        {
            question: "How many videos can I create?",
            answer: "That depends on your plan. You can start for free to explore the editor, and upgrade for higher limits and expanded export options."
